        Put together quickly using Gridsome, the AirTable "Product catalog" base and queries to display data with GraphQL that is pre built into Gridsome.
      </p>
      <p>At first I found it hard to understand the Gridsome process, but reading the docs I was able to make pages and query the data to be displayed using <code>&lt;page-query&gt;</code> for pages, and <code>&lt;static-query&gt;</code> for components</p>
      <p>I can talk about my process more in person!</p>
